# and replace CERT_AUTHORITY_ID if the partner provides one.
# Example placeholder lines (DO NOT upload these placeholders as-is):
# appnexus.com, SELLER_ID_OR_ACCOUNT, DIRECT, CERT_AUTHORITY_ID
# openx.com, SELLER_ID_OR_ACCOUNT, DIRECT, CERT_AUTHORITY_ID

# Notes:
# 1) Save this file as exactly: ads.txt (lowercase)
# 2) Upload to your website root so it's accessible at:
#    https://metaadata.com/ads.txt
# 3) For other ad networks, ask them for the exact line to add (they'll give you SELLER ID).
# 4) Google may take 24-72 hours to re-crawl and update status in AdSense.
# 5) Do NOT add other publisher IDs you don't own.
